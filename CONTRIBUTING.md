# How to contribute üçµ
To contribute, the usual standard process is to make a fork of the repository and open a Pull Request (PR) in the official repo, which will be reviewed by me or anyone that has permissions to admit PRs inside the repo.

_In case you have permissions to make branches because you're a maintainer, create new branches inside the repo_.

You'll need to follow this rules to contribute:
- **Fork the repository / create a branch**: Start by forking the repository or creating a branch inside it if you have permissions to do so.
- **Clone your fork**: Clone the fork you've made in your local machine to start doing some work.
- **Create a new branch**: Create a new branch for a feature or bug fix. Use a descriptive name, like: `feat/new-feature-name` or `fix/issue-description`.
    - `fix`
    - `feat`
    - `doc`
    
Are the ones allowed.

- **Make your changes**: Write your code, make sure to follow the project's formatting and linting rules. Be ware of what I use, as I'll and try to maintain the code as clean and modularized as possible. I use _Hexagonal Architecture + DDD (Domain Driven Design) + Featured Based_ in the backend for the front I just try to have everything as reusable and componetizable as possible.

- **Push your fork**: Push your changes to your fork on Github.
- **Open a Pull Request**: Navigate to the Original repository on Github and open a pull request. Make sure the title of the PR is clear and descriptive and your description explains properly the changes you've made, if you want you can follow this even though they're for changelogs: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
