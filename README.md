## What is Merino?
**The _first_ note taking app where block style editing meets markdown.**

_Merino_ is a note taking app designed to be private & easy-to use with markdown support first.

### First where block style meets markdown?
_You might have that question_, and yes, it's true that Notion exists, and also Obsidian, both wonderfull note taking apps.

But Merino is different, because we have the block style of Notion, the markdown of Obsidian and differently to Notion, we save the notes as _markdown files_, making it compatible with anything that uses markdown.

> [!WARNING]
> There will be dragons, the app is on beta and there are bugs and missing features, be patience while you use this in beta state.

## Features
- **Markdown Support**: Merino supports markdown syntax to create rich text content with all its benefits.
- Easy to use and private, we don't store anything on the cloud, only locally for you, we will give you the option to sync your notes across devices or server if needed (coming soon).
- **Block Style Editor**: You can edit text in a block style way.
- **Customizable ðŸ˜Ž**, you like themes and customization? We got you covered.

All the features are in the [Docs](#docs).

## Docs
ðŸ˜“ Sorry, I didn't do the docs yet. But I'm working on them! They are in a sepparate repository to avoid confussions.

## Contributions
This is an Open Source project, this means anyone can commit to the application with new features and improvements.

For now they are closed, because I need to make a guide and some kind of rules for contributing. So It will come soon.
